## USAGE

### CODE INFO

This JavaScript code retrieves information about your device and sends it to a Telegram bot using Telegram's API.

The information collected includes your public IP address, location, device language, user agent (browser), platform, screen dimensions, color depth, cookie settings, and more.

To make this code work, you need to replace the placeholders "TELEGRAM_BOT_API_KEY" and "YOUR_CHAT_ID" with your own values.

You can obtain a Telegram bot API key by creating a new bot through Telegram's BotFather, and you can find your chat ID by sending a message to the bot and checking the bot's API response.

Once you've replaced the placeholders with your own values, you can run this code in a web browser's developer console or in a JavaScript file loaded by a web page.

To edit the code, you can modify the variables and functions defined in the code to collect different or additional information, or you can modify the message sent to the Telegram bot to include or exclude certain information.
