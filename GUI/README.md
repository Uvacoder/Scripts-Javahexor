**NOTE : Do not edit or Rename the GUI File such as key.txt . the program will get the input of your key and chat id and replace it in key.txt and append in the locate.js file and save it in the script file . When you click on clone website . it will scrap and download and save index.html file and apend the js file in the index file**
